## 📊 Internship Tasks
### 🛳️ Titanic Survival Prediction
- Created a predictive model to determine passenger survival likelihood on the Titanic.
- Used machine learning algorithms such as **Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forest**.
- Focused on **feature selection, data preprocessing, and model evaluation**.

### 🎬 Movie Rating Prediction
- Developed a regression model to predict movie ratings based on metadata like **genre, director, and cast**.
- Explored **feature engineering, data visualization, and regression models**.
- Compared performance of models like **Linear Regression and Random Forest**.

### 🌸 Iris Flower Classification
- Built a classification model to identify **Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica** flowers.
- Implemented **KNN, Decision Trees, and SVM** for classification.
- Visualized patterns in the dataset with **scatter plots and correlation heatmaps**.

## 🔧 Technologies Used
- **Python** (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- **Jupyter Notebook** & **Google Colab**
- **Machine Learning Models** for classification and regression
